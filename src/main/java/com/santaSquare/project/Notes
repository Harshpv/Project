##** KISS

Mappings:

user-group: 1:many
group-event: 1:1
event- user-map: 1:many
event- exclusion-map: 1:many

UseCase:

User-
- register himself
- creates event that makes him event admin
    - invites/removes other users to event
    - schedules or start an instant event
    - cancels event
- user sends/receives secret message from other user once event starts
- user updates/acks the status of gift once event starts
- update address for an event

todo:
complete user register part using oauth
